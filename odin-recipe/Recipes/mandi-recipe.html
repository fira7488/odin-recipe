      "Mandi" refers to a traditional Yemeni dish consisting of meat and rice
      cooked with a special blend of spices in a pit, popular in the Arabian
      Peninsula and beyond
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
      <ol>
        Rice (cooked rice)
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Meat (chicken, lamb or goat )
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Mandi Spice Mix(cumin, cardamom, cloves and etc)
      </ol>
      <ol>
        Other spices(onion, oil, galrlic and ginger paste)
      </ol>
    </ul>
    <h1>Step to cook mandi</h1>
    <p>
      Step 1: Marinate the meat (chicken or lamb) with spices, garlic, ginger,
      lemon, yogurt. Let sit for a few hours. Step 2: Brown the meat in a pot,
      then add water and simmer until tender. Alternatively, roast in the oven.
      Step 3: Prepare the rice by sautéing onions, adding spices, rinsed rice,
      and broth. Step 4: Layer the partially cooked meat on top of the rice.
      Step 5: Smoke using the charcoal method. Step 6: Bake everything together
      until rice is done. Step 7: Garnish with fried nuts and raisins. Wait, but
      when baking, the rice and meat need to cook together. So maybe after
      layering, cover tightly and bake at a low temperature, like 350°F, for
      30-40 minutes. The smoking step could be done just before baking, by
      placing the hot charcoal in the pot for a few minutes, then removing it
      and sealing the pot to bake. Also, some recipes parboil the rice first,
      then layer it with the meat and bake. That might help prevent overcooking.
      Alternatively, if using the absorption method, the rice cooks in the broth
      in the oven. I need to make sure the meat is tender. If using chicken,
      maybe bone-in pieces, which take less time than lamb. Lamb might require
      longer cooking time, so perhaps braise it first until tender, then layer
      with rice. The key is to get the smoky flavor, the tender meat, and the
      fragrant, spiced rice. Also, the presentation: the rice is often yellow,
      served with the meat on top, garnished with nuts and herbs.
